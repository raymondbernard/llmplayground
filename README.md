# LLM Playground

**Ray Bernard**  
*Email: ray.bernard@outlook.com*

## Overview

This repository explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, focusing on reducing hallucinations by integrating **Reflection LLM** mechanisms with vector stores. The project showcases practical applications using models such as **LLaMa3** and **Reflection LLM**, while demonstrating common issues with hallucination and potential solutions involving vector databases for factual accuracy.

## Features

- **Reflection LLM**: Demonstrates how reflection mechanisms can improve the accuracy of LLM outputs by prompting internal reasoning before generating responses.
- **Vector Store Integration**: Uses **ChromaDB** to store and retrieve contextually relevant data, helping reduce hallucinations.
- **One-Shot and Multi-Shot Learning**: Examples provided for both one-shot and multi-shot learning approaches, demonstrating how they affect LLM responses.
- **Monty Hall Problem Example**: Tests the models' handling of the Monty Hall problem, highlighting how even reflection LLMs can falter without accurate external data.

## Setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raymondbernard/llmplayground.git
    cd llmplayground
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes:
   ```bash
   ollama
   chromadb
   ```

3. Make sure to install **Ollama** and **ChromaDB** in your Python environment.

### Example Code Files

The repository contains several Python scripts to demonstrate the concepts of reflection LLMs and vector stores:

- **play.py**: Demonstrates baseline LLM reflection and vector database integration for user prompts. [See code](19).
- **play-oneshot.py**: Implements a one-shot learning example using LLaMa3 for response generation. [See code](20).
- **play-multishot.py**: A multi-shot learning example that reduces hallucination significantly. [See code](22).
- **play-mutishot-reflectllm.py**: Combines multi-shot learning with the Reflection LLM to further improve the model's response accuracy. [See code](21).

## Usage

1. **Running the baseline example**:
   ```bash
   python play.py
   ```
   This script interacts with the **Reflection LLM** and uses **ChromaDB** to create a vector database from previous conversations.

2. **One-shot learning example**:
   ```bash
   python play-oneshot.py
   ```
   This demonstrates how LLaMa3 responds to user prompts, using one-shot learning for improved context handling.

3. **Multi-shot learning example**:
   ```bash
   python play-multishot.py
   ```
   Multi-shot learning significantly reduces hallucinations by retrieving context from the vector store and comparing multiple inputs.

4. **Multi-shot Reflection LLM example**:
   ```bash
   python play-mutishot-reflectllm.py
   ```
   This combines multi-shot learning with the **Reflection LLM**, leveraging both techniques to further improve the model’s response accuracy.

## Example: The Monty Hall Problem

A common test case used throughout this project is the **Monty Hall problem**:

> Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host asks you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2 instead?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

This problem, in various forms, tests the model's ability to reason based on incomplete information. The provided scripts demonstrate how different LLMs—especially reflection-based models—handle this problem.

## Conclusion

The **LLM Playground** explores how the use of reflection mechanisms and vector stores can help reduce hallucinations in LLMs, while demonstrating the practical applications of one-shot and multi-shot learning. As the open-source community continues to contribute, this project aims to foster innovation in building more reliable, self-correcting models.
